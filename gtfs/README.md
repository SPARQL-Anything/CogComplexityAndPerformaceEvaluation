# GTFS-SA

GTFS-SA is an extension of the [GTFS-Madrid-Bench Benchmark](https://github.com/oeg-upm/gtfs-bench) for assessing execution of SPARQL Anything queries.

## Requirements

- Docker v0.20.10 or later for running GTFS-Madrid-Bench Benchmark
- Java11+

## Using GTFS-SA

1. Clone this repository

```

git clone https://github.com/SPARQL-Anything/experiments
cd experiments/

```

2. Generate data using [GTFS-Madrid-Bench](https://github.com/oeg-upm/gtfs-bench#using-madrid-gtfs-bench) and move the ``result`` folder generated by GTFS within ``experiments`` folder.
At the moment only csv, json and xml formats are allowed.

3. Generate SPARQL queries for the scales passed to GTFS (e.g. 1, 10, 100)

```

./generate_queries.sh "1 10 100" "TMP_FOLDER"

```

4. Clone download the latest [release of the SPARQL Anything](https://github.com/SPARQL-Anything/sparql.anything/releases) (e.g. sparql-anything-0.6.0.jar)

5. Run the queries

```

./execute_queries.sh sparql-anything-0.6.0.jar "1 10 100" "csv json"

```
